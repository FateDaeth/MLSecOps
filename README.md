## About Project :
##### Create a automated system which will be useful for a server in terms of following features
<hr>
 1. This system will keep log of the information about the clients hit or request to the server for example we can get log file of a webserver at location /var/log/httpd/<br>
 2. This log data of clients will be used for finding the unusual pattern of a client request for example if a client is sending request repeatedly. for this purpose we can use here clustering to make clusters of different patterns of client request and to identify which cluster of client requests can cause some security and performance issue in the server<br>
 3. If any kind of unusual pattern we got then we can use jenkins to perform certain task for example it can run some command to block that ip which is causing this trouble.
